Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rachel!

Iâ€™m currently a student at Ohio State University, studying Astronomy and Astrophysics, and will be graduating the Spring of 2025. I am passionate about data analytics and machine learning, and am 
currently searching for a full-time role within this industry. I enjoy creating predictive models to find an ideal solution to complex problems, and am interested in any projects that would allow me to do so.


ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in...

Data Analytics: I work with data to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights using tools like Python and SQL.

Machine Learning: I build and implement predictive models, working with algorithms like decision trees, regression models, and neural networks.

Data Visualization: I create compelling visualizations using tools like Matplotlib to help understand complex data.

Research & Projects: I apply data science methodologies to a variety of real-world projects.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

Deepening my understanding of advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks).

Exploring AI in business applications like automation and optimization.

Working on a new classification project to strengthen my knowledge of machine learning techniques.


Iâ€™m always eager to learn new techniques and apply them in real-world scenarios, and am always looking for new projects to collaborate on!
